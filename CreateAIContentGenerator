# Step by Step Guide

Build your own AI-powered content generator using fully local tools (no OpenAI). 

This generator will let users input a niche and get multiple posts with emojis and hashtags—outputting .txt or .csv formats.

## Tool kit

- Python - It's where all your code, logic and LLM interaction, lives.

- VS Code + Python extension - The easiest, free, professional coding editor. You will run your python and streamlit apps from here.

- Ollama - This runs your Large Language Model we are using Mistral.

- Streamlit (clean dashboard UI) - turns your python into a web app with zero front end coding.

- Your own machine - Local Hosting (no internet needed after setup)
